Traffic signs classification for vehicles â€“ A Multi-class, single-image classification project

**Background and Motivation:**
Traffic sign recognition is a lucrative real-world problem which we have chosen to address due to its high practical relevance, especially in the context of its application in transportation. Traffic signs are designed to catch the eye of the human driven and be easily recognized. They usually follow standard design, shape and color to aid accurate recognition. However, many real-world factors such as weather conditions, lighting in the environment and field of view might come into play; often leading to the drivers being misguided. There may also be instances when the human drivers may be unable to interpret the signs due to lack of knowledge. This can be mitigated using machine learning algorithms to accurately classify images of traffic signs, which could ultimately be used to prompt the drivers with clear instructions pertinent to the traffic signs. This capability can also be extrapolated to autonomous vehicles. To achieve level-5 autonomous, accurate classification would help the vehicles understand and follow traffic rules.

**Problem Statement:**
The aim of this project is to read and classify traffic signs which is a very important task for all vehicles. There are several different types of traffic signs like speed limits, no entry, traffic signals, turn left or right, children crossing, no passing of heavy vehicles, etc. Traffic signs classification is the process of identifying which class a traffic sign belongs to.
